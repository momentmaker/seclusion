# planning

Planning is important to get in state of what is to come going into the seclusion.

There are several things to consider when planning a seclusion.

## duration

The easiest time would be for a weekend since most people's worldly duties are done during the weekdays.

Another option would be for a long weekend with an extra day for seclusion.

Of course the duration is up to each individual and can go as long as a whole week if one has the capacity.

For a group seclusion, it is best to discuss the time and dates well ahead in order to accommodate everyone's schedule.

## accomodation

It will be necessary to get oneself out of the usual living environment because there are preexisting energy patterns that we have created in those spaces.

It is crucial to find a new environment free from those patterns that is serene and peaceful.

There are several platforms one can book a place for the weekend: [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) | [vrbo](https://www.vrbo.com) | [booking](https://www.booking.com)

How many rooms for the place will be dependent on how many individuals will be partaking in the seclusion.

It is imperative to have a separate room for each individual to have their own space as that space will be their sanctuary for the entire duration of the seclusion.

Generally when choosing a place, it is best to find a place that is in nature and away from the city. Something near the forest or lake would be ideal.

## food

The selection of food is important because the food we consume has a direct impact on our mental and physical well-being.

The best food to consume during a seclusion is vegetarian food. It is light and easy to digest and does not create any heaviness in the body.

Of course juicing or fasting are also great options to have.

The goal is to disconnect the taste sense pleasure we normally get from our daily life.

One can either bring their own cooked food ahead of time or bring the ingredients to cook their own food during the seclusion.

For a group seclusion, it is best to discuss ahead of time whether to bring food themselves or cook together.

Cooking together in silence with harmony while being connected within can be a great experience.

Another topic to bring up is whether to eat meals together in silence or eat separately in their own rooms.

## what to bring

**DO NOT** bring any form of electronics like smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc.

One should bring only the essentials like clothes, toiletries, and any other personal items that are necessary for a weekend.

This includes any props one needs for meditation or extended periods of sitting.

One can bring a journal to write down their thoughts and experiences during the seclusion. A book can also be brought to read during the seclusion but only one and one should be one of spiritual nature.

For group seclusion, an idea could be to randomly assign a person to another and have each bring a book that they think would be beneficial for the other person to read during the seclusion.
